  title: What is Datenlord ?,
  con: ["DatenLord is a next-generation cloud-native distributed storage system, which aims to be
              application-orientated software-defined storage (SDS) platform. On one hand, DatenLord is designed as a
              cloud-native storage system, which itself is distributed, fault-tolerant, and graceful hot-upgrade. These
              cloud-native features make DatenLord easy to use and easy to maintain. On the other hand, DatenLord is
              designed
              as an application-orientated storage system, which is called “Computing Defined Storage”, in that
              DatenLord
              is
              optimized for many application scenarios, such as databases, big data, AI machine learning, and especially
              container ecosystems. DatenLord provides high-performance storage service for containers, which
              facilitates
              stateful applications running on top of Kubernetes (K8S). The high performance achieved by, DatenLord is
              by
              leveraging the most recent technological revolution in hardware and software, such as NVMe, non-volatile
              memory,
              asynchronous programming, and the native Linux asynchronous IO support."
